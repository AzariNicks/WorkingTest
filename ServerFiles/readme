This is gonna be sorta a guide file for me , so I can refrence it later when I wanna upload another server 
so were gonna use node.js so were gonna have to install some dependeys so we can get the server up and running 
and then i wanna add some visuals to the server so we know it looks good 

Step One , add the imports,express,cors,path and then create an port 
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3456;
this is important to keep so that it can be local or not depending on if its uploaded or not
